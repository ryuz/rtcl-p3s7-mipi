# Global-Shutter MIPI High-Speed Camera (PYTHON300 + Spartan-7)

## Overview

This repository provides the KiCad design data for the global-shutter MIPI high-speed camera introduced [here](https://rtc-lab.com/products/rtcl-cam-p3s7-mipi/).

This is a compact, R&D-oriented camera module built with the onsemi [PYTHON300 image sensor](https://www.onsemi.com/products/sensors/image-sensors/python300) and the AMD (Xilinx) [Spartan-7 FPGA](https://www.amd.com/en/products/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/fpga/spartan-7.html).


Although the sensor is VGA-class on the datasheet and rated for up to 815 fps, we have achieved 1000 fps capture at 320Ã—320 when connected to a [KV260](https://www.amd.com/en/products/system-on-modules/kria/k26/kv260-vision-starter-kit.html) or [Zybo Z7](https://digilent.com/shop/zybo-z7-zynq-7000-arm-fpga-soc-development-board/).

Sample videos and more details are also introduced [here](https://rtc-lab.com/products/rtcl-cam-p3s7-mipi/).

## Related Software

Currently, there is a project that sends data to the KV260 using a custom specification.

- [Spartan-7 Design](https://github.com/ryuz/rtcl-designs/tree/main/projects/rtcl_p3s7_mipi/rtcl_p3s7_mipi)
- [KV260 Design](https://github.com/ryuz/rtcl-designs/tree/main/projects/kv260/kv260_rtcl_p3s7_hs)

We have also confirmed that it's possible to connect to ZYBO at reduced speeds and comply with MIPI-CSI standards, but these projects are not yet prepared, so please look forward to future developments.

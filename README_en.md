# Global-Shutter MIPI High-Speed Camera (PYTHON300 + Spartan-7)

## Overview

This repository provides the design data for a compact, R&D-oriented camera module built with the onsemi [PYTHON300 image sensor](https://www.onsemi.com/products/sensors/image-sensors/python300) and the AMD (Xilinx) [Spartan-7 FPGA](https://www.amd.com/en/products/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/fpga/spartan-7.html).

The hardware was designed using KiCad.

Although the sensor is VGA-class on the datasheet and rated for up to 815 fps, we have achieved 1000 fps capture at 320Ã—320 when connected to an [KV260](https://www.amd.com/en/products/system-on-modules/kria/k26/kv260-vision-starter-kit.html).
